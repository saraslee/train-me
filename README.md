# train me
Created a pet communication app prototype inspired by dog training buttons.   Hoping to deploy this on ipad and tablets.  
View prototype at https://saraslee.github.io/train-me/

# current features
If a button of a certain color is clicked, the device vocalizes the word.  The user also has the ability to change the voice of the speaker.  Uses web API speech synthesis.  

# soon to be added features 
Record your own voice and add your own commands coming soon.
