# train me
Currently creating a pet communication app prototype inspired by dog training buttons.

Hoping to make my web app ipad and tablet compatible.   


# current features
If a button of a certain color is clicked, the device vocalizes the word.  The user also has the ability to change the voice of the speaker.  The web app uses the web API speech synthesis.  

# soon to be added features 
1) Record your own voice to add your own commands coming soon.
