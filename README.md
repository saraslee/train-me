# train me
Currently creating a pet communication app prototype inspired by dog training buttons.

# current features
If a button of a certain color is clicked, the device vocalizes the word.  The user also has the ability to change the voice of the speaker.  The web app uses the web API speech synthesis.  

# to be added features 
1) Record your own voice to add your own commands.
2) Customizable buttons and button sizes based on paw size.
